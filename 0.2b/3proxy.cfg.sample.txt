#
# config file for 3proxy
# enter gateway commands line-by-line
#
#   log [[@]logfile] [<LOGTYPE>]
#	sets logfile for all gateways
#	@ - use syslog
#	LOGTYPE is one of:
#		M - Monthly
#		W - Weekly
#		D - Daily
#		H - Hourly
#	if logfile is not specified logging goes to stdout
#	You can specify individual logging options for gateway by using
#	-l option in gateway configuration.
#
#   rotate <n>
#	how many archived log files to keep
#
#   archiver <ext> <commandline>
#       Archiver to use for log files. <ext> is file extension produced by
#	archiver. Filename will be last argument to archiver, optionally you
#	can use %A as archive name and %F as filename.
#
#   internal <ipaddr>
#	sets ip address of internal interface. This IP address will be used
#	to bind gateways. Alternatively you can use -i option for individual
#	gateways
#
#   external <ipaddr>
#	sets ip address of external interface. This IP address will be source
#	address for all connections made by proxy. Alternatively you can use
#	-e option to specify individual address for gateway.
#
#    service
#	Should be specified to launch as NT/2000/XP service, no effect for
#	Unix.
#
#    daemon
#	Should be specified to close console (needn't for service).
#
#    auth
#	Type of user authorization. Currently supported:
#	none - no authorization required
#	iponly - authorization by source/destination IP and ports
#	nbname - iponly + authorization by NetBIOS name. Messanger
#		service should be started on user's machine. Note, that
#		Windows 95/98 hosts do not have messanger service by default,
#		WinPopup program need to be started.
#		NB: there is no any password check, name may be spoofed.
#		Think about it as about ident for Windows.
#	 Q: Will ident authorization be implemented?
#	 A: Yes, as soon as it will be required by someone.
#	strong - username/password authentication required. It will work only
#		 with SOCKSv5 and HTTP proxy.
#
#    allow <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist>
#    deny <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist>
#    redirect redirect_ip redirect_port <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist>
#	Access control entries. All lists are comma-separated, no spaces are
#	allowed. Usernames are case sensitive (if used with authtype nbname
#	username must be in uppercase). Source and target lists may contain
#	IP addresses (W.X.Y.Z) or CIDRs (W.X.Y.Z/L). Targetportlist may
#	contain ports (X) or port lists (X-Y).
#	* sign means "ANY".
#    	If access list is empty it's assumed to be
#		allow *
#    	If access list is not empty last item in access list is assumed to be
#		deny *
#	Access lists are checked after user have requested any resource.
#	If you want 3proxy to reject connections from specific addresses
#	immediately without any conditions you should either bind proxy
#	to appropriate interface only or to use ip filters.
#	Redirect causes connection to be accepted, but outgoing connection
#	to be redirected to different ip/port if user's connection matches
#	to rule.
#	For example
#		redirect 192.168.1.2 80 * * * 80
#	causes all outgoing web traffic to be redirected to 192.168.1.2 web
#	server
#	
#    users username[:pwtype:password] ...
#	pwtype is one of:
#		none (empty) - use system authentication
#		CL - password is cleartext
#		CR - password is crypt-style password
#		NT - password is NT password (in hex)
#	example:
# users test1:CL:password1 "test2:CR:$1$lFDGlder$pLRb4cU2D7GAT58YQvY49." test3:NT:BD7DFBF29A93F93C63CB84790DA00E63
#	
#
#    flush
#	empty active access list
#
#    system
#	execute system command
#
#    setuid <uid>
#	call setuid(uid), uid must be numeric. Unix only.
#
#    setgid <gid>
#	call setgid(gid), gid must be numeric. Unix only.
#
#    chroot <path>
#	call chroot(path). Unix only.
#
# You can include files by using $<filename> macro. For included file new line
# character treated as space character.


#system "echo Hello world!"
# you may use system to execute some external command if proxy starts

users 3APA3A:CL:3apa3a "test:CR:$1$qwer$CHFTUFGqkjue9HyhcMHEe1"
# note that "" required, overvise $... is treated as include file name.
# $1$qwer$CHFTUFGqkjue9HyhcMHEe1 is 'test' in MD5 crypt format.
#users @/usr/local/etc/3proxy/passwd
# this example shows you how to include passwd file. For included files
# <CR> and <LF> are treated as field separators.

service
# service is required under NT if you want 3proxy to start as service


#log /usr/local/etc/3proxy/logs/3proxy.log D
log c:\3proxy\logs\3proxy.log D
# log allows to specify log file location and rotation, D means logfile
# is created daily

#archiver gz /bin/gzip %F
#archiver zip zip -m %A %F
#archiver zip pkzipc -add -silent -move %A %F
archiver rar rar a -df -inul %A %F
# if archiver specified log file will be compressed after closing.
# you should specify extension, path to archiver and command line, %A will be
# substituted with archive file name, %f - with original file name.
# Original file will not be removed, so archiver should care about it.

rotate 30
# We will keep last 30 log files

auth iponly
#auth nbname
#auth strong
# auth specifies type of user authentication. If you specify none proxy
# will not do anything to check name of the user. If you specify
# nbname proxy will send NetBIOS name request packet to UDP/137 of
# client and parse request for NetBIOS name of messanger service.
# Strong means that proxy will check password. For strong authentication
# unknown user will not be allowed to use proxy regardless of ACL.
# If you do not want username to be checked but wanna ACL to work you should
# specify auth iponly.


#allow ADMINISTRATOR,root
#allow * 127.0.0.1,192.168.1.1 * *
#redirect 192.168.1.2 80 * * * 80
#allow * 192.168.1.0/24 * 25,53,110,20-21,1024-65535
# we will allow everything if username matches ADMINISTRATOR or root or
# client ip is 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. Overwise we will redirect any request
# to port 80 to our Web-server 192.168.0.2.
# We will allow any outgoing connections from network 192.168.1.0/24 to
# SMTP, POP3, FTP, DNS and unprivileged ports.
# Note, that redirect may also be used with proxy or portmapper. It will
# allow you to redirect requests to different ports or different server
# for different clients.

#  sharing access to internet

external 0.0.0.0
# external is address 3proxy uses for outgoing connections. 0.0.0.0 means any
# interface. Using 0.0.0.0 is not good because it allows to connect to 127.0.0.1

internal 127.0.0.1
# internal is address of interface proxy will listen for incoming requests
# 127.0.0.1 means only localhost will be able to use this proxy. This is
# address you should specify for clients as proxy IP.
# You MAY use 0.0.0.0 but you shouldn't, because it's a chance for you to
# have open proxy in your network in this case.

#external $./external.ip
#internal $./internal.ip
# this is just an alternative form fo giving external and internal address
# allows you to read this addresses from files

proxy
pop3p
# Now we starting HTTP and POP3 proxy with settings above

#tcppm 25 ns.my.provider 25
#udppm -s 53 mail.my.provider 53
# we can portmap port TCP/25 to provider's SMTP server and UDP/53
# to provider's DNS.
# Now we can use our proxy as SMTP and DNS server.
# -s switch for UDP means "single packet" service - instead of setting
# association for period of time association will only be set for 1 packet.
# It's very userfull for services like DNS but not for some massive services
# like multimedia streams or online games.

auth strong
fflush
allow 3APA3A,test
socks
# for socks we will use password authentication and different access control -
# we flush previously configured ACL list and create new one to allow users
# test and 3APA3A to connect from any location



# map external 80 and 443 ports to internal Web server
# examples below show how to use 3proxy to publish Web server in internal
# network to Internet. We must switch internal and external addresses and
# flush any ACLs

#auth none
#flush
#external $./internal.ip
#internal $./external.ip
#tcppm 80 websrv 80
#tcppm 443 websrv 443

#chroot /usr/local/jail
#setgid 65535
#setuid 65535
# now we needn't any root rights. We can chroot and setgid/setuid.

#daemon
# now we will not depend on any console (daemonize).
