  crashing on active usage.

  on FreeBSD between send() and gethostbyname() somewhere causing SIGPIPE on

10.09.2003
! Bug in SOCKSv5 UDP mapping corrected. Now it works fine (checked with
  Unreal Tournament) with both SocksCAP and FreeCAP.

06.08.2003
! Algorithm for SOCKS5 bind/udp assoc port selection is now intellegent
  enough to allow server applications to use same port number on socks
  server if available and not denied by access list
! SOCKS5 bind/udp assoc now matches incoming connections/packet
  with IP address from request in accordance to RFC 1928 to improve
  security

04.08.2003
!!! Bug fixed sometimes causing 3proxy to crash if parent proxy is used
!!! UDP associate finaly completed and is fully functional
    (tested with SocksCAP on Unreal Tournament). 
!!! TCP bind code re-checked, and is probably working (doesn't work
    on SocksCAP because of SocksCAP bug
!!! Socket leak on nbname auth fixed

21.07.03
+ Web administration module created
+ Dynamic enable/disable for counters now available via web interface

06.11.2002
!!MARK IT 0.2beta
! Using UPX to compress 3proxy.exe


02.11.2002
+ HTTP proxy now supports kepp-alive connections to HTTP server or proxy.
  It dramatically decreases number of outgoing connections and amount of DNS
  traffic.

01.11.2002
+ Now proxy can catch Web server style requests. It means proxy
  may be used as a transparent proxy. Yes. It means you can redirect
  SOCKS requests with target 80 to HTTP proxy.
! Port check in ACL fixed
! Now proxy catches redirection by changed destination IP or port. If
  you redirect request to web server make sure it supports proxy style
  requests (IIS and Apache do).
+ HTTP proxy supports keep-alive. Now number of threads required
  significantly reduced.
+ HTTP CONNECT fully supported (both direct and redirected to another proxy).
  Now you can use our proxy for HTTPs. Or for spam :) Don't forget to set ACL
  for outgoing ports, cause now ports are not limited.

26.10.2002
+ mycrypt utility added for making crypted passwords in NT and crypt/MD5
! ACL check for strong auth corrected
+ HTTP proxy support for authentication (basic). Now you can use strong
  username/password authentication with proxy module.
+ Error messages added for HTTP proxy

25.10.2002
+ NT passwords are now supported in 3proxy.cfg
! Public License Agreement changed to be more clear

24.10.2002
! Fixed handle leak because of missed CloseHandle for threads in Windows

23.10.2002
! Fixed POP3 proxy bug
! Strong auth changed to allow rules with * for username
+ MD5 crypt format passwords is now supported... Do we ever need DES?
  I will not implement blowfish - it's huge and rarely used.
+ More comments added to 3proxy.cfg.sample

21.10.2002
! Fixed strongauth problem - ACL was not checked for authenticated
  SOCKSv5 users

16.10.2002
+ Added support for SOCKSv5 cleartext password authentication
+ "strong" authentication is now OK (use it only for SOCKS)
+ added "users" config file command to specify username and password. Only
  cleartext for a while.

20.09.2002
! Minor improvements in socket operations

17.09.2002
! HTTP proxy changed to do not strip hostname from URI if target port is not
  80. It allows to redirect requests to another proxy as well as redirect to
  different Web server via ACL. It will work for most servers (IIS, Apache)
  if target redirected to non-standard port of Web server, but may fail in
  some rare cases. Redirection to proxy should always work OK except if proxy
  is on TCP/80.
+ Added "redirect" ACL command. You can redirect request to another destination
  if ACL entry matches (that is by target or source IP, target port, username).
! Fixed documentation bug in 3proxy.cfg.sample ("authtype" instead of "auth")
! Fixed bug causing server to exit in native Win32 mode if "service"
  configuration option is not configured
! Outgoing SOCKS connections are handled in common way now.

07.09.2002
+ added binding to external interface for outgoing connections
! Fixed bug causing username check in ACL always fail
+ Added ACL check for UDP map
+ Added "Single packet" services to UDP portmap (-s switch). Allows unlimited
  number of clients to be handled by portmapper for single-packet services
  (like DNS).
