# config file for 3proxy
# enter gateway commands line-by-line
#
#   log [[@]logfile] [<LOGTYPE>]
#	sets logfile for all gateways
#	@ - use syslog
#	LOGTYPE is one of:
#		M - Monthly
#		W - Weekly
#		D - Daily
#		H - Hourly
#	if logfile is not specified logging goes to stdout
#	You can specify individual logging options for gateway by using
#	-l option in gateway configuration.
#
#   rotate <n>
#	how many archived log files to keep
#
#   archiver <ext> <commandline>
#       Archiver to use for log files. <ext> is file extension produced by
#	archiver. Filename will be last argument to archiver, optionally you
#	can use %A as archive name and %F as filename.
#
#   internal <ipaddr>
#	sets ip address of internal interface. This IP address will be used
#	to bind gateways. Alternatively you can use -i option for individual
#	gateways
#
#   external <ipaddr>
#	sets ip address of external interface. This IP address will be source
#	address for all connections made by proxy. Alternatively you can use
#	-e option to specify individual address for gateway.
#
#    service
#	Should be specified to launch as NT/2000/XP service, no effect for
#	Unix.
#
#    daemon
#	Should be specified to close console (needn't for service).
#
#    authtype
#	Type of user authorization. Currently supported:
#	none - no authorization required
#	iponly - authorization by source/destination IP and ports
#	nbname - iponly + authorization by NetBIOS name. Messanger
#		service should be started on user's machine. Note, that
#		Windows 95/98 hosts do not have messanger service by default,
#		WinPopup program need to be started.
#		NB: there is no any password check, name may be spoofed.
#		Think about it as about ident for Windows.
#	 Q: Will ident authorization be implemented?
#	 A: Yes, as soon as it will be required by someone.
#	strong - username/password authentication required (not implemented
#	yet).
#
#    allow <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist>
#    deny <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist>
#	Access control entries. All lists are comma-separated, no spaces are
#	allowed. Usernames are case sensitive (if used with authtype nbname
#	username must be in uppercase). Source and target lists may contain
#	IP addresses (W.X.Y.Z) or CIDRs (W.X.Y.Z/L). Targetportlist may
#	contain ports (X) or port lists (X-Y).
#	* sign means "ANY".
#    	If access list is empty it's assumed to be
#		allow *
#    	If access list is not empty last item in access list is assumed to be
#		deny *
#	Access lists are checked after user have requested any resource.
#	If you want 3proxy to reject connections from specific addresses
#	immediately without any conditions you should either bind proxy
#	to appropriate interface only or to use ip filters.
#	
#    flush
#	empty active access list
#
#    setuid <uid>
#	call setuid(uid), uid must be numeric. Unix only.
#
#    setgid <gid>
#	call setgid(gid), gid must be numeric. Unix only.
#
#    chroot <path>
#	call chroot(path). Unix only.
#
# You can include files by using $<filename> macro. For included file new line
# character treated as space character.
