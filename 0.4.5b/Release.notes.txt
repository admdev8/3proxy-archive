 Known bugs:

	- udppm doesn't work if compiled with cygwin. 

	  Cygwin doesn't support recvfrom()/sendto() on connected socket, so
	  recv/send is used instead... Not a big deal anyway.

	- FTP over HTTP support leaks some important features and have
	  significant issues

	  Use 0.5b-devel, it's stable enougth with improved FTP support.


 Planned for future release:
   - Web interface for configuration
   - Signal handling on Unix (for stop/pause/resume/configuration change)
   - External filter API
   - Addon URL, antiviral, HTTP cache filters
