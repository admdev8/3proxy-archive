 Known bugs:

	- udppm doesn't work if compiled with cygwin. 

	  Cygwin doesn't support recvfrom()/sendto() on connected socket, so
	  recv/send is used instead... Not a big deal anyway.

	- udppm works without authentication

	  Will be patched later.

	- socks5 doesn't work with UDP

	  Not implemented yet

 Planned for future release:
